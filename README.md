# 📘 Queue Data Structure in JavaScript

## 📖 Introduction
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle — the element inserted first is removed first.  
It is widely used in real-world scenarios such as printer queues, task scheduling, and data buffering.
